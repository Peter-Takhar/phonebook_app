Phonebook Application

This is a simple project that displays a phone book directory. Each contact stored in the phone book contains three fields: first name, last name and phone number. You have the ability to add contacts, search for contacts through the three fields, delete, sort by the contact fields, save the contacts and load contacts from a file if possible.
